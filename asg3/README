**Note:

I wasn't sure, in the case of multiple files, if I was
supposed to create new listmaps for each individual file
or use the same one for all of them.  Upon further
examination, run6.files from the sample-output folder
seems to suggest the latter.

test2.in never inserted an "a" key, but it's printed out
on line 31 of run6.files.

If this turns out to be incorrect, I apologize.
